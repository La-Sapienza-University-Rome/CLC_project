# CLC_project

## Setup the AWS  infrastructure (so far)
- Setup an AWS Cloud9 IDE and clone the repository
- Open the file `aws_config/operations_log_template` and emit the commands in the console of the AWS Cloud9 IDE
- Replace the PLACEHOLDERS with the proper keys stored in the `output_config` files (those generated by the commands)
- May refer to [this tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/it/getting-started/hands-on/build-modern-app-fargate-lambda-dynamodb-python/module-two/) to get more information.

## What is done (so far)
- Deployment of the app on AWS Fargate
- Connection to the S3 buckets
- Loading of the model from S3 [need the code for loading the actual model, but a generic file can be already loaded from S3]
- Handling of the whole dataset with AWS Aurora Serverless and integration of it with the app [in progress]

## To do
- Consolidate the data handling
- Run the right model and present the results
- Test the app
- Report and presentation
